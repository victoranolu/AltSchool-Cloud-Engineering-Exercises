# Networking, IP Addressing

On the exercise given about subnetting an IP address. The IP address is 193.16.20.35/29 and was asked to know what the Network IP, Broadcast IP, number of hosts, range of IP addresses. 

<pre><code> IP Address: 193.16.20.35/29
 Network IP: 193.16.20.32
 Broadcast IP: 193.16.20.39
 Number of Hosts: 8
 Number of Usable Hosts: 6
 Netmask: 255.255.255.248
 Range of IP addresses: 193.16.20.33 - 193.16.20.38</code></pre>

 # Conclusion

 It was another challenging concept to understand. Network, IP addressing, Subnetting and how the Internet works. I love it regardless and consulting more study material i can fairly say i can calculate subnet mask and run the binary code of IP address.
