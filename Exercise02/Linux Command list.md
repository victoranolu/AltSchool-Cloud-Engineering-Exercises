# Learning Other Basic Linux Commands 

In this exercise, I was instructed to find other Linux commands and how they are used or more sepcifically how it functions in the Linux environment. Here are a few of such commands ranging from user management to network management and some process management commands;

# Ps
`Ps` can take a look at processes a current shell session is running. It prints useful information about the programs you're running. Processes like PID, time, command name etc.

# Ping

`ping` is used to test network connectivity. In this screenshot I used ping command to ping my IP address.

# History

`history` comes in handy when one struggles to remember a command. It will display a list of commands used in the past.
