In this week exercise, we learned about version control and open source community github and how to use git. The demo by the instructor on the LMS was very much explainatory in submitting our exercises and how to possibly contribute to the open source community. I am not yet there in mastering it, so far I have not had much issues in submitting my exercises. 

On the exercise I was asked to submit the output of `git config -l`, `git remote -v`, `git log`. In this folder are the outputs of each of them. 

Great week in becoming a world class engineer
